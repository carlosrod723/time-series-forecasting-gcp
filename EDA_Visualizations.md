## Exploratory Data Analysis Visualizations

In this section, I explore the transformed weather data using various visualizations created with Google Looker Studio from the Google Cloud Platform. Google Looker Studio allows me to connect directly to the BigQuery dataset, enabling seamless integration and dynamic visualizations. This powerful tool facilitates the creation of interactive and shareable reports that can be easily updated with new data.

By connecting the `transformed_weather_data` table in BigQuery to Looker Studio Studio, I can create insightful visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. These visualizations provide valuable insights that will inform the feature engineering and model development processes.

The visualizations included in this section aim to highlight key aspects of our weather data, such as seasonal patterns in temperature and precipitation, the distribution of temperature values, and geographical differences in weather conditions. Each visualization is accompanied by a brief description, the SQL query used to create the underlying data, and the insights derived from the visualization.

Below are some of the key visualizations created to understand our weather data better.
